 Vlad: I developed a Blazor WebAssembly component that retrieves gasoline and diesel price data through two API requests, deserializes it into a Fuel model, and processes it on a Razor page. The data is mapped into a FuelViewModel, where I calculated statistical metrics such as the last price, average, median, and variance for each fuel type. I then configured a BlazorBootstrap LineChart to visualize the data, combining and deduplicating date labels for the x-axis and mapping price values for the y-axis, applying distinct colors for benzin and diesel. Additionally, I created a table displaying both fuel types with their calculated statistics, and implemented error handling to show a warning message if data retrieval fails, ensuring that data is loaded and rendered only once for better performance.
